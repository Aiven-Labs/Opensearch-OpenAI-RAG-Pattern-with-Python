    "# Semantic search using OpenSearch and OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through an example of using [Aiven for OpenSearch](https://go.aiven.io/openai-opensearch-os) as a backend vector database for OpenAI embeddings and how to perform semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why using OpenSearch as backend vector database\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSearch is a widely adopted open source search/analytics engine. It allows to store, query and transform documents in a variety of shapes and provides fast and scalable functionalities to perform both accurate and [fuzzy text search](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/term/fuzzy/). Using OpenSearch as vector database enables you to mix and match semantic and text search queries on top of a performant and scalable engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure to follow the prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An [Aiven Account](https://go.aiven.io/openai-opensearch-signup). You can create an account and start a free trial with Aiven by navigating to the [signup page](https://go.aiven.io/openai-opensearch-signup) and creating a user.\n",
    "2. An [Aiven for OpenSearch service](https://go.aiven.io/openai-opensearch-os). You can spin up an Aiven for OpenSearch service in minutes in the [Aiven Console](https://go.aiven.io/openai-opensearch-console) with the following steps \n",
    "    * Click on **Create service**\n",
    "    * Select **OpenSearch**\n",
    "    * Choose the **Cloud Provider and Region**\n",
    "    * Select the **Service plan** (the `hobbyist` plan is enough for the notebook)\n",
    "    * Provide the **Service name**\n",
    "    * Click on **Create service**\n",
    "3. The OpenSearch **Connection String**. The connection string is visible as **Service URI** in the Aiven for OpenSearch service overview page.\n",
    "4. Your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n",
    "5. Python and `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook requires the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `openai`\n",
    "* `pandas`\n",
    "* `wget`\n",
    "* `python-dotenv`\n",
    "* `opensearch-py`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the above packages with:"
