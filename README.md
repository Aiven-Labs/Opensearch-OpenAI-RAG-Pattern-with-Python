# Implementing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with OpenAI and OpenSearch

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/aiven-labs/Opensearch-OpenAI-RAG-Pattern-with-Python)

This notebook demonstrates how to use semantic search to retrieve relevant information from a dataset using the OpenAI API and [Aiven for OpenSearchÂ®](https://aiven.io/opensearch).

## Getting Started

This repo uses a jupyter notebook to walk through the process of creating an OpenSearch datastore in Aiven and searching against it using the OpenAI API.

### Setup your Aiven Account

You will need an [Aiven](https://aiven.io/) account. You can sign up for an account.

### Create an OpenSearch service

You can create an OpenSearch service in the Aiven console by selecting the OpenSearch service. You can choose the cloud provider and region you want to deploy the service in.

You can also create the service using the Aiven CLI.

### Create an OpenAI API key

Our semantic search will be powered in-part by [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/oerview). In order to use the API, you will need to create an API key and purchase credits.

- Visit <https://platform.openai.com> and sign in or create an account
- On the left sidebar, select **Settings**, followed by **Billing**
- Select **Add to credit balance** (You will need to add a payment method)

### [Option 1] Create a new codespace in GitHub

You can use the `code` button in the top right of the repo or the badge at the top of the readme to create a new codespace in GitHub. This will create a new environment with all the required dependencies to run the notebook.

### [Option 2] Setup the project locally

- fork the repo to your own GitHub account
- clone the repo to your local machine
- ensure Python is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS, the Window Store on Windows, or your package manager of choice on Linux.
  ```shell
  python --version
  ```
- create a virtual environment based on your [operating system](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- install the dependencies

  You can install the python dependencies using pip.

  ```shell
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
